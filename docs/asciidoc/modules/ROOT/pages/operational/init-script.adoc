:description: This section describes a hook to run Cypher commands after database initialization.



Apoc optionally allows you to run a cypher command after database initialization is finished.
This can e.g. be used to ensure indexes/constraints are created up front.

To use this feature use a config option:

[source,config]
----
apoc.initializer.cypher=CALL apoc.cypher.runSchemaFile("file:///indexes.cypher")
----

For running multiple statements you can also add suffixes to the config options, like `cypher.1`, `cypher.2`.
The statements will then be executed in sort-order.

[source,config]
----
apoc.initializer.cypher.1=CALL apoc.cypher.runSchemaFile("file:///indexes.cypher")
apoc.initializer.cypher.2=CALL apoc.cypher.runFile("file:///setupTriggers.cypher")
----
